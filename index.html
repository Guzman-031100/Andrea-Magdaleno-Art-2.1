        <h2>About Andrea</h2>
        <p>Andrea is a Chicago Illustrator. She graduated from Columbia College Chicago obtaining a Bachelors in the
            Arts
            focusing on Children’s <br>
            Illustration. She found her inspiration from Rachel Renee Russel’s books at the age of 10 and began drawing
            ever since. It wasn’t until she <br>
            reached high school that she discovered about Columbia, and did what was needed to get into the school.
            Through her studies in college, she <br>
            learned so many sides of illustration and found another passion, greeting cards. Ever since she started
            college, she did commissions of doing <br>
            people’s invitations and making greeting cards. Now that she will soon be an alumni, she is always pursuing
            her goals of being an important <br>
            role in children's books and illustrating people’s ideas to life.
